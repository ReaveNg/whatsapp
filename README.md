Resources Research
# whatsapp
A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app
Created meta for developer account. 
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/sample-app-endpoints#
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started

Built up websites that could be the webhook and token bearer for my api app. 
Follow through the api creation with glitch
1) https://speckle-dandelion-bridge.glitch.me
Push the api to my whatsapp account. 
However I realised I am unable to verify my token.

Subsequently, I used 2nd method listed on in my resource research -> WhatsApp Business Platform On-Premises API
Follow through the api creation with glitch and built my 2nd website.
2) https://talented-star-tuna.glitch.me

Afterwhich, I realised my application cannot work. Simply because fb banned my token, and required me to verify my identity and business. 
The following are the error messages presented by meta. 

"Access token invalidation FYI
This application has been identified as having access tokens associated with it posted in a public GitHub repository. As a security measure, we have invalidated the session for these particular tokens.
As stated in our Platform Terms, you must not transfer or share access tokens and secret keys, except with a Service Provider who helps you build, run or operate your app. These tokens must be kept secret and not shared publicly. Disclosing access tokens to the public may result in unauthorized access to your app.
This action was taken as part of the GitHub secret scanning program. We have partnered with GitHub on this scanning program to protect Facebook users by automatically invalidating Facebook access tokens when they are shared in a public GitHub repository."

After verification and convert the app into "live"
I am able to mesg my own phone as a sample.  

After which, I tried to connect the application function into the glitch site, by creating a HTML button for it. 
However, the code did not work.
